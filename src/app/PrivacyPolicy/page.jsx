            To further ensure the confidentiality of your personal information,
            we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and
            managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we
            collect online. We use data collection devices such as cookies on
            certain pages of the Site to help analyze our web page flow, measure
            promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. Cookies are

            - Persistent cookies: These usually have an expiration date and stay
            in your browser until they expire or until you manually delete them.
            For example, we use persistent cookies to better understand usage
            patterns so that we can improve the site for our customers.
